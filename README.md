        <p>Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a high school student with a strong passion for the engineering field, particularly in the realm of <strong>computer development</strong>. I consistently engage in coding projects, where I apply my knowledge primarily using Java. These projects reflect not only my technical abilities but also my curiosity and drive to explore new concepts in programming. I upload these projects to share my journey and insights with others.
            
Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me!</p>

I am always eager to learn and grow, seeking out opportunities to expand my skill set and embrace new challenges. My current experience includes proficiency in <strong>Java, JavaScript, Python, and HTML/CSS</strong>, and I am committed to refining my expertise in these languages while also exploring other areas within the field of STEAM.
